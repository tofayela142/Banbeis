Project Title: A Smart Fish Farm Monitoring and Management System using IoT and Machine Learning
Summary:
This project aims to develop a smart fish farm monitoring and management system leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning technologies to ensure high-quality fish production. The system will enable real-time water quality monitoring, automatic fish feeding decisions, and fish disease detection, with a focus on Tilapia fish farming. The project will be implemented in selected ponds in Begumganj/Companyganj, Noakhali district.

In the first year, the project will involve an extensive literature review, site selection, equipment procurement, site preparation, and fish stocking. Sensor data for water quality parameters—such as pH, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen—will be collected. An automatic fish feeding system will dispense a fixed amount of feed at scheduled intervals. Machine learning algorithms will be applied to predict water quality and identify the most effective model for management. Real-time alerts will inform stakeholders about pond conditions, while waterproof cameras will capture fish images for disease detection.

The project is supervised by Dr. Nazia Majadi, Associate Professor at Noakhali Science and Technology University. Sekh Torikul Islam is working as a Research Assistant from July 7, 2024, for the next three years.
